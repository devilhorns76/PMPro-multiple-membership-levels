# PMPro-multiple-membership-levels
Plugin for PMPro that allows multiple membership levels for each member, including recurring membership levels and one-time-purchase levels.

This plugin requires that you setup your level 1 membership level to be the "customer" membership level, while level 2 must be the "free subscriber" level.

All levels 3 and up are for the actual products/membership levels customers pay for.

When someone pays to become a member, they are actually signing up for level 1 (customer membership), and the actual membership level they are purchasing is added on (similarly to the PMPro Add-on plugin).

This plugin allows for each customer/member to purchase any/all of your memberships, that way you can offer different products and different memberships, whether one-time purchases or recurring.
